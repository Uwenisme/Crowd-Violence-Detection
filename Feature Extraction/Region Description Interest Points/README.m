% typically the GEP method was designed to avoid using interest points,
% this is because we wanted to model global features as opposed to local,
% but in the interest of SCIENCE, we've decided to implement the same
% features based on spatio-temporal interest points; essentially, at each
% identified point a volume of MxNxT will be extracted and processed,
% essentially each point will be a small frame
